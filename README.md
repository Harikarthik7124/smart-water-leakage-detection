ðŸ’§ Smart Water Leakage Detection

Sustainable Water Resource Management using AI/ML

Project Overview

This project leverages AI/ML techniques to detect water leakages using pipeline sensor data, aiming to optimize water usage and support sustainable urban water management.

ðŸŒ± Week 1 Milestone â€“ Data Preprocessing & EDA (30% Progress)
ðŸ”¹ Dataset Overview

Source: Smart Water Leak Detection Dataset â€“ Kaggle

Key Features: Flow_Rate, Pressure, Temperature, Vibration, RPM, Operational_Hours

Location Info: Zone, Block, Pipe, Location_Code, Latitude, Longitude

Target Variable: Leakage_Flag (continuous numeric for regression)

ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing Steps

Filled missing values in sensor readings

Encoded categorical variables (Zone, Block, Pipe, Location_Code)

Scaled numeric columns for uniformity

Saved as cleaned_dataset.csv

ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution Plots: Flow_Rate & Pressure




Correlation Heatmap:


Boxplots: Detect outliers


Leakage Analysis: Pairplots & grouped averages


Insights:

Flow and Pressure are strong indicators of leakage events

Leakage events cluster around abnormal flow and pressure values

ðŸ“Œ Week 2 Milestone â€“ ML Model Development & Evaluation (60% Progress)
ðŸ”¹ Model Choice & Justification

RandomForestRegressor handles non-linear relationships, works with mixed feature types, and provides feature importance.

ðŸ”¹ Model Training & Evaluation

Split data: 80% train, 20% test

Trained RandomForestRegressor with 100 estimators

Metrics:

RMSE: 0.0132

RÂ² Score: 0.9894

MAE: 0.0101

ðŸ”¹ Deployment

Saved model: rf_leakage_model.pkl

Load & predict:

import joblib
loaded_model = joblib.load('rf_leakage_model.pkl')
new_predictions = loaded_model.predict(new_data)
