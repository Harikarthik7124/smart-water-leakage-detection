ðŸ’§ Smart Water Leakage Detection

Sustainable Water Resource Management using AI/ML

Project Overview

This project analyzes pipeline sensor data to detect water leakages and optimize water usage. The goal is to support sustainable urban water management by leveraging AI/ML algorithms for proactive leak detection and monitoring.

ðŸ“Œ Week 1 Milestone â€“ Data Preprocessing & EDA (30% Progress)

During Week 1, the primary focus was dataset preparation and exploratory analysis to understand patterns and relationships in the data.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset Overview

Source: Smart Water Leak Detection Dataset â€“ Kaggle

Key Columns:

Sensor readings: Flow_Rate, Pressure, Temperature, Vibration, RPM, Operational_Hours

Location info: Zone, Block, Pipe, Location_Code, Latitude, Longitude

Target variable: Leakage_Flag (continuous numeric for regression)

ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing

Filled missing values in sensor readings

Encoded categorical variables (Zone, Block, Pipe, Location_Code)

Scaled numeric columns for uniformity

Cleaned dataset saved as: cleaned_dataset.csv

ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution plots for Flow_Rate and Pressure

Correlation heatmap of numeric features

Boxplots for outlier detection

Leakage distribution analysis (imbalanced dataset)

Pairplots to observe relationships between Flow, Pressure, and Leakage_Flag

Grouped averages to identify patterns indicating leaks

ðŸ”¹ Week 1 Insights

Flow and Pressure are strong indicators of leakage events

Leakage events cluster around abnormal flow and pressure values

Dataset is now clean and ready for feature engineering and model building

ðŸ“Œ Week 2 Milestone â€“ ML Model Development & Evaluation (60% Progress)
ðŸ”¹ Model Choice & Justification

RandomForestRegressor chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships, work with mixed feature types, and provide feature importance insights.

Robust baseline model for regression on continuous Leakage_Flag.

ðŸ”¹ Model Training

Dataset split into train (80%) and test (20%)

Trained RandomForestRegressor with 100 estimators

Feature scaling applied to numeric columns; categorical features encoded

ðŸ”¹ Evaluation Metrics

RMSE: 0.0132

RÂ² Score: 0.9894

MAE: 0.0101

MAPE: 4.2%

ðŸ”¹ Visualization

Scatter plot of Actual vs Predicted Leakage_Flag

Feature importance plot showing key predictors: Pressure, Flow_Rate, RPM, and Vibration

ðŸ”¹ Model Deployment

Model saved using joblib as rf_leakage_model.pkl

Loading model and making predictions on new data:

import joblib
loaded_model = joblib.load('rf_leakage_model.pkl')
new_predictions = loaded_model.predict(new_data)


Ready for integration into dashboards or web apps (e.g., Streamlit)
